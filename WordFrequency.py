###The program should create a dictionary in which the 
#keys are the individual words found in the file and the values are the number of times each word appears. 
##For example, if the word “the” appears 128 times, the dictionary would contain an element with 'the' as the key and 128 as the value. 
##The program should display the frequency of each word.
